This video demonstrates how to create a local repository using Sourceree. You should already be familiar with these Git locations. We will use Sourcetree to create a local repository, which automatically includes the working tree and staging area. For a new local repository, the working tree and staging areas start out empty and no commits are in the local repository. To create a local repository using Sourcetree, select New, then Create Local Repository. You will then be asked to specify the destination path and name of the local repository. The destination path specifies the project directory. Notice that in this example, the project directory is located inside the repo's directory, which you should have configured as the default Git project directory location earlier. The name of the repository usually matches the project directory name, so as you type the name in the destination path, the name field will automatically be completed to match. Here, we are calling our project directory and repository repoa. We then clicke Create to create the local repository. We have now created a local repository named repoa. After you've created a local repository, you can navigate to your project directory on your file system. Here, we've navigated to the repo's directory, where we find our repoa project directory. Inside of the project directory, we see the hidden.git directory, which contains the staging area and local repository. You may need to make hidden directories visible in your file manager in order to see it. We have also just added a file called sampleprojectfile.txt to the working tree, just as an example project file that Git could manage. It's time for you to create your own local repository using Sourcetree. Separate instructions are provided for you to follow.
