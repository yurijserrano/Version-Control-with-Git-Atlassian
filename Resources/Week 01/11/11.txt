In this video we will discuss creating a local repository using a command line. You should already be familiar with these Git locations. We will use a command line to create a local repository which automatically includes the working tree and staging area. For a new local repository, the working tree and staging area start out empty, and no commits are in the local repository. You can execute the git init command in an empty directory to initialize or create a repository. Here we are in our home directory and we create a repos directory. This is a recommended single location for all of your local repositories on your computer. We change directories to the repos directory. Next, we'll create a project directory. We are naming this directory myproj. We change into the myproj directory. Now that we are inside of our project directory, we can execute git init to begin managing our project directory with Git. Notice that Git responds with a message saying that it has initialized and empty Git repository inside of a newly created dot Git directory in the project directory. We can now list the contents of the project directory, specifying the dash a flag to include hidden directories. Notice that Git has created a dot git directory. In your project directory you now have an empty working tree and a hidden dot git directory. The dot git directory contains an empty staging area and a local repository containing no commits. It's time for you to create your own local repository using a command line. Separate instructions are provided for you to follow.
