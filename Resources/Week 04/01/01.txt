This is the first of two
videos on pull requests. We will start with
the pull request overview. Pull requests are a feature of Git hosting
sites such as BitBucket and GitHub. The ultimate goal of a pull request is
to merge a branch into the project. Pull requests enable team communication
related to the work of the branch. Notifications related to the pull
request can be sent to team members. Those team members can provide feedback or comments and ultimately can have
a say in approving the content. This can act as a form of code review. There are two basic repository
configurations related to pull requests. The first is a single remote repository. A pull request in a single
repository configuration is a request to merge
a branch of the repository. The second configuration
involves two remote repositories. In this configuration,
a pull request is a request to merge a branch from a forked repository
into the upstream repository. The fork approach is common if
the submitter doesn't have write access to the upstream repository. You can create a pull request which
is also called opening a pull request any time during the life of the branch. You can open a pull request
when you create the branch. This enables the team to begin discussion
on the work of the branch immediately. You can also open a pull request when
you want comments on the branch. For example, you may be stuck
implementing something and want to ask the team for help. And finally, you can open the pull request
when you think the branch is ready for review and merging. As you can see, a pull request can be opened at any time
after the related branch is created. Next, we will discuss single
repository pull requests. Before making a pull request,
you need to prepare to make the request. To prepare to make the pull request,
first you create a feature branch. This is the branch that we
hope will eventually be merged into a longer running branch. You can work on the feature branch
before opening a pull request. But to start the team discussion, you can also open a pull request
immediately after creating the branch. You then push the branch
to the remote repository. To open a pull request,
you can log in to BitBucket, navigate to your remote repository and
click on Pull requests. Here you can create or view any pull
request related to the repository. Let's create a pull request by clicking
the create a pull request link. You are presented with a pull
request form to fill out. You title your pull request, add
a description of work done on the branch, optionally specify specific
reviewers of the pull request and then click create pull request. When a pull request has been submitted to
you, you will see the pull request in your BitBucket dashboard which is
part of the overview tab. You can see here that we have no pull
requests waiting for our review and you can see the pull
requests that we created. When you are reviewing a pull request, you
can see the full context of the request. You can review the information
of the pull request itself. You can see what has
changed in the project and you can see the comments that were made. This is where you can
add your own comments. You can click approve to add to the count
of approvers of the pull request. Your project might require
a certain number of approvals before the merge is allowed. A person doing the merging of the pull
request can gain confidence depending on how many people approve it, and
by who specifically approves it. Click decline to reject or
remove the pull request. Be careful if you do this
because it cannot be undone. Click edit to update the pull request. You do not need to do this if
you add a commit to the branch, the pull request will
automatically be updated. Could merge to begin the process
of merging the branch. Remember that merging is the ultimate
goal of the pull request. You will then be asked to
select a merge strategy. You can create a merge commit or
you can squash. A squash will reduce the entire
branch to one linear commit, you don't have to use one of these
strategies to perform the merge. You can use your local client to
merge the branch just as usual. When you push the merge
to the remote repository, the pull request will be closed. Here is a review of what we've
discussed in this video. Pull requests are opened using an online
Git host such as BitBucket or GitHub. The ultimate goal of a pull
request is to merge a branch, but they also facilitate team discussion and
approval. You can open a pull request any
time after creating the branch. You do not need to edit the pull request
if you add a commit to the branch. You can merge the pull request
using an online Git host or by pushing the merge
from your local client. Now it's time to work on the topics
discussed in this video. Separate hands-on
instructions are provided.
